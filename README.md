# Vision-Arch

**Vision-Arch** is a web application that transforms 2D architectural floor plans into interactive 3D spaces. Using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, users can build a 2D plan, then explore the design in a detailed, 3D-rendered view with realistic models, textures, reflections, and shadows.

## Features

- **Upload 2D Plan**: 
  - Use the drag-and-drop tool to place, move, and position elements in your 2D floor plan.
  - Build your custom 2D layout by arranging items in each room.
  - Once completed, you can save your design and return to the home page.
  
- **Explore Sample House**: 
  - Visualize your created 2D plan in 3D with realistic textures, shadows, and lighting effects.
  - Experience a fully interactive 3D version of your custom layout with enhanced visuals.
